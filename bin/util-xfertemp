Usage: util-xfertemp [FILENAME]
       util-xfertemp list

Moves a file from the /tmp/ directory into the current user's home directory and chown's
it so the current user can open/modify it. This command is primarily intended for getting
an output file from an isql query. For instance, in isql, a user may run the following:

    select * from da01_organization
    go > /tmp/da01.txt

This is will write the output to the /tmp/ directory. After exiting isql, the user can run
the following from the tk command line:

    util-xfertemp da01.txt

and the file will be moved to the user's home directory and chown'ed to the current user and group.

With no arguments provided, this message is displayed.
